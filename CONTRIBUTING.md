## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Clear variable names (prefer clarity over brevity)
- Add comments explaining *why*, not just *what*
- Include docstrings for functions

**Markdown:**
- Use clear headings
- Break up long paragraphs
- Include code examples
- Link to relevant resources

### Content Principles

All contributions should align with the course philosophy:

✅ **Concepts before code** - Explain the "why" first
✅ **Simplicity over production** - Focus on clarity
✅ **Deep and detailed** - Don't rush, ensure understanding
✅ **Encourage experimentation** - Learning from mistakes is valuable

❌ **Don't:**
- Add complex enterprise patterns
- Skip conceptual explanations
- Assume prior knowledge
- Use jargon without defining it

### Testing Changes

Before submitting a PR:

**For code:**
- Run the code yourself
- Test on a fresh environment (new venv)
- Verify logs/outputs match expected results

**For documentation:**
- Read it fresh (as if you're a learner)
- Check all links work
- Verify code examples run
- Test with Claude Code (if applicable)
