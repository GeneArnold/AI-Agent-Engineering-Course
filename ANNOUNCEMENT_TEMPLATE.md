🎁 My Holiday Gift to the Developer Community

I'm excited to share a free AI Agent Engineering Course I've been working on!

🎯 What you'll learn:
• How AI agent loops actually work under the hood
• Building agents with tool calling and function execution
• Memory management with vector databases (RAG)
• Multi-agent orchestration patterns
• Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration

🚀 What makes this different:
This course uses AI-assisted learning with Claude Code. You'll learn by discussing concepts and understanding architecture - the same way modern engineers actually work. It's meta: using AI to learn AI!

📚 Course Structure:
• Module 1: Agent Foundations
• Module 2: Memory & Context
• Module 3: Tools & Local Models
• Module 4: Multi-Agent Systems
• MCP Add-On Track

✨ This release includes:
✅ Complete course curriculum
✅ Setup instructions
✅ Learning objectives and concepts
✅ Project specifications

No prior agent experience required - if you can code in Python, you can build agents.

Hey everyone!

I've been learning AI agent engineering, and I wanted to share what I've learned as a holiday gift.

I just released a free course on building AI agents from scratch.

Here's what makes it unique: it uses AI-assisted learning with Claude Code. You learn by understanding concepts and architecture, not just typing syntax.

The course covers:
- Agent loops and tool calling
- Memory with vector databases
- Multi-agent systems
- And Model Context Protocol

Check it out on GitHub - link in the description.

Star the repo for updates. Happy holidays and happy building!

Subject: 🎁 Free AI Agent Engineering Course - My Holiday Gift

Hey [Name],

I wanted to share something I've been working on as a holiday gift to the developer community.

I recently completed an AI agent engineering training program, and I've packaged everything into a free, open-source course for others to learn from.

**What You'll Build:**
By the end of this course, you'll have built:
- A simple agent with tool calling
- A memory-enabled agent using vector databases
- A multi-tool agent with local/cloud models
- A multi-agent system with orchestration
- Custom MCP servers

**AI-Assisted Learning:**
This course uses Claude Code as your AI professor. You'll learn by discussing concepts and understanding trade-offs - the same way modern engineering teams work with AI assistants.

**Get Started:**
https://github.com/GeneArnold/AI-Agent-Engineering-Course

No prior agent experience required. If you can code in Python, you can build agents.

Star the repo to stay updated on future module releases!

Happy holidays,
Gene Arnold

Title: [P] Free AI Agent Engineering Course - Learn by Building

I just released a free AI agent engineering course as a holiday gift to the community.

**What's included:**
- Complete curriculum for 4 modules + MCP track
- Setup instructions and environment config
- Hands-on projects (weather agent, memory agent, multi-agent systems)
- AI-assisted learning approach using Claude Code

**What makes it different:**
Instead of just copying code, you learn by discussing concepts with an AI professor (Claude Code). You understand WHY agents work the way they do, not just HOW to type the syntax.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python basics
- Curiosity about how agents work
- That's it!

I'm releasing module solutions over the next few weeks. Star the repo for updates!

Happy to answer questions in the comments.
