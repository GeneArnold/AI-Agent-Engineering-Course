# Advanced Topics

This folder contains advanced topics that are NOT part of the core 7-module curriculum. These topics focus on infrastructure, tooling, and production concerns rather than core agent engineering patterns.

## Available Topics

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
**Status:** Complete content, planned for separate advanced course
**Location:** `mcp/`
**Focus:** Standardized tool protocols, MCP architecture, server integration

**Why not core curriculum:**
- Infrastructure/tooling topic, not core agent pattern
- Requires 5+ lessons (too much for one module)
- Deserves dedicated advanced course

**When to explore:**
- After completing core 7 modules
- When building production agent systems
- When standardizing tools across multiple agents

---

### Local Models & Quantization
**Status:** Planned content, moved from Module 3
**Location:** Future - `local_models/`
**Focus:** Ollama, quantization, provider abstraction, local inference

**Why not core curriculum:**
- Infrastructure optimization, not agent engineering pattern
- Agent patterns are identical whether using OpenAI or Ollama
- Hardware-dependent, complex setup

**When to explore:**
- After completing core modules
- When you need offline/local inference
- When exploring model optimization

## Future Advanced Topics

Potential topics for future advanced courses:
- Production deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, scaling)
- Monitoring and observability
- Security and sandboxing
- Cost optimization
- API rate limiting and queueing
- Multi-tenancy patterns

## How to Use This Content

**These topics are optional and self-guided.** They're here for students who:
1. Completed the core 7-module course
2. Want to explore infrastructure and production topics
3. Are building real-world agent systems

**Core curriculum first!** Master the 7 core modules before diving into advanced topics.
